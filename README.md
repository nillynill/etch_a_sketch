Etch-a-Sketch Project 

PART 1:
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript. Grid squares will be inside a container div.  written in an HTML file. Use Flexbox.

PART 2:
Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would.

PART 3:
Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. 
(Instead of a popup window, I get a number from the user by a input box of a number type)


PART Extra 1:
Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.

PART Extra 2: (I skipped this for the moment, prioritizing finishing the curriculum)
Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
